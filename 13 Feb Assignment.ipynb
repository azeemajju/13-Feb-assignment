    "(Q6):List down some best practices for exception handling in python. \n",
    " \n",
    " Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use specific exception types: Catching specific exceptions rather than generic ones can make your code more readable and maintainable. For example, use ValueError instead of Exception when you know a specific type of error could occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catch exceptions only when necessary: Catching exceptions when you don’t need to handle them can make debugging harder and can hide potential bugs in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use try/except blocks for exceptions: Python’s try/except blocks are a great way to handle exceptions in your code. Use them to isolate and handle exceptions that could occur in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use finally blocks for clean-up code: Use finally blocks to define clean-up code that should be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. This can include releasing resources like files, sockets, and database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use context managers: Context managers are a Python construct that helps manage resources and ensure that they are cleaned up properly. They are particularly useful when dealing with file I/O, database connections, or network sockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log exceptions: Logging exceptions can help you debug your code and identify potential problems in your application. Python’s logging module is a great way to log exceptions and other events in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raise exceptions when appropriate: Sometimes it may be necessary to raise an exception in your code when something unexpected happens. This can help make your code more robust and can make debugging easier."
